-differences in gravitational surface of earth
-topography/bathimetry(under sea/depth)
-different heights (ellipsical, geoid, )
-projections: cylinder, cone, plane
-conformal: angles preserved; aphilactic(authomecoic): distances preserved; equivalent: areas preserved
-most recommended: universal transversa mercator
-ICGC: different map data
