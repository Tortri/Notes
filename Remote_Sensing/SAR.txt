-multiple small antennas together
-infinite impulse response not possible
-resolution dependent on l or distance 
-the more distance from target, the more time to see target,the less doppler
-main issue: range and azimuth resolution not independent -> freq domain calculation 
-mountains distorted because peak appears before bottom (image based on time)
-speckle noise: wavelength in cm, pixel in meters, focus points either destructive or constructive

to review:
-sinc function
-azimuth, range (direction of satellite)
-doppler slope 
-delta tau
-doppler bandwidth 
-PRF pulse rep. freq.
-aliasing, sample frequency
-fundamental SAR equations
-SNR
-gaussian pdf
