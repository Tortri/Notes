# High Availability
-- Layer 2 HA:
- RSTP prevents loops in Ethernet networks and provides fast convergence, ensuring only one active path between switches.
- MRP provides loop avoidance and fast convergence in ring topologies by designating a device as the manager to control the ring and detect failures.
- REP offers fast convergence and a loop-free topology in Ethernet networks using ring topology, with primary and secondary edge ports managing traffic to prevent loops.
- PRP provides hitless redundancy with zero recovery time by allowing end nodes to send duplicate packets through two independent networks.
- HSR achieves zero recovery time in ring topologies by sending traffic in both directions, allowing quick recovery from failures.
- DLR ensures minimal recovery time for critical IACS applications by using embedded switch technology in a ring topology with active monitoring and quick reconfiguration during faults

-- Layer 3 HA:
- FHRPs like HSRP and VRRP ensure router redundancy by allowing multiple routers to provide backup default gateways for end systems.
- HSRP provides high network availability by allowing multiple routers to function as a group, presenting a single virtual router to hosts.
- VRRP, an open standard protocol, provides similar functionality to HSRP, allowing multiple routers to act as a single virtual router to ensure continuous network availability.
